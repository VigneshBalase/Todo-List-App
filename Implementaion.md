## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### Client Side Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>/client
Install Dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Start the Application:
```
npm start
```


Open the app in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

Server Side Setup
Navigate to Server Folder:


cd <repository-name>/server
Install Dependencies:

```
npm install
```
Create .env File: Add your environment variables:

```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/todo-app
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
```
Run the Server:

For development:
```
npm run dev
```
For production:
```
npm start
```
✅ Assumptions & Design Decisions
Built as a Single Page Application (SPA) for smooth navigation.

React Router is used for client-side navigation without page reloads.

Axios handles API communication with better promise-based support.

JWT is implemented for user session management and route protection.

RESTful APIs structure the backend for modularity and clarity.

🔐 Security Features
Password hashing via Bcryptjs.

Input validation and sanitization.

Rate limiting to defend against brute-force attacks.

Secure headers with Helmet middleware.

🛠 Setup Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed

MongoDB running locally or using a cloud MongoDB URI

Create .env in server/ folder with required variables

🧪 Testing & Build Commands
